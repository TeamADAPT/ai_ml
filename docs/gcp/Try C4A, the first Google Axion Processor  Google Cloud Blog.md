At Google Next ‘24, [we announced Google Axion Processors](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu), our first custom Arm®-based CPUs designed for the data center. Today, we’re thrilled to announce the general availability of C4A virtual machines, the first Axion-based VM series, with up to 10% better price-performance than the latest generation Arm-based instances available from leading cloud providers. C4A VMs are a great option for a variety of general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, and AI inference applications. 

Underpinned by [Titanium](https://cloud.google.com/titanium) offload technology and advanced maintenance capabilities, C4A is designed to power your most demanding workloads with up to 65% better price-performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances.<sup>1</sup>

C4A delivers up to 30% better price-performance for MySQL and up to 35% better price-performance for Redis workloads than comparable current-generation VMs.\*

These efficiency and performance gains are why key Google services such as Bigtable, Spanner, BigQuery, F1 Query, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform have already started deploying Axion-based servers in production.

"Spanner is one of the most critical and complex services at Google, powering products including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Ads. In our initial tests on Axion processors, we've observed up to 60% better query performance per vCPU over prior generation servers. As we scale out our footprint, we expect this to translate to a more stable and responsive experience for our users, even under the most demanding conditions." – Andi Gutmans, VP/GM Databases, Google

Google Cloud customers can use C4A in many services including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Batch, and Dataproc. C4A VMs are also now available in preview in Dataflow, with support for CloudSQL, AlloyDB, and other services coming soon. C4A instances support most popular Linux operating systems including Container-Optimized OS, RHEL, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, and more. Arm-compatible software and solutions are available on the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en), and we recently launched support for Arm-based instances migration in the [Migrate to Virtual Machines](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines) service in preview.

C4A broadens our [general-purpose VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines) portfolio, and is offered in a range of configurations:
