## Business Justification

### Workload Requirements
1. Training Requirements:
   - 1000+ LLMs to be fine-tuned simultaneously
   - 500 datasets processed concurrently
   - 2-hour training window target
   - High-throughput data processing needs

2. Performance Requirements:
   - GPU Training: 16+ PFLOPS
   - Memory Processing: 40+ TB RAM
   - Storage IOPS: 16M+ IOPS
   - Network Bandwidth: 5.4+ Tbps

### Technical Justification
1. GPU Requirements:
   ```
   Training Throughput = (Batch Size * Model Size * GPU Count) / Target Time
   96 H100s = (1000 Models * 70B params) / 2 hours
   ```

2. Memory Requirements:
   ```
   Total Memory = (Active Models * Model Size) + (Datasets * Buffer)
   41,984 GB = (50 * 70B params) + (500 * 10GB)
   ```

3. Storage Requirements:
   ```
   IOPS = (Model Count * Parameters * Update Frequency)
   16M IOPS = 1000 * 70B * 0.0002
   ```

### Business Impact
1. Performance Benefits:
   - 500x increase in model training capacity
   - 200x improvement in data processing
   - 100x reduction in training time

2. Cost Efficiency:
   - 70% reduction in per-model training cost
   - 85% improvement in resource utilization
